# remove_ocp_roks ansible role

> role used to delete an IBM Cloud ROKS cluster

## Requirements 

1. The "ibm.cloudcollection". Version 1.8.2 is currently known to work. Newer versions are known to cause issues with the embedded roles. To install: `ansible-galaxy collection install ibm.cloudcollection`. You can also use the "requirements.yml" file located in 'ansible/request-ocp-roks-play'. 
2. IBM-Cloud terraform-provider-ibm v1.9.0
3. Terraform v0.12.20

        dataCenter: wdc04 # Provide the data center (zone) to deploy to
        hardware: shared # shared for virtual workers
        resourceGroup: default # Provide the Resouce Group name where the cluster is deployed -- default is "default" resource group
        apikey: 1234567890123456 # Set the api key here to use for IBM Cloud authentication
      collections:
        - ibm.cloudcollection

## Removing a cluster through an Ansible Container

*Container Dockerfile that would include all tools necessary for running in a Docker container:*

```
FROM centos:7
# set up os and install ansible
RUN yum install -y epel-release && yum update -y && yum install git openssh-clients.x86_64 ansible.noarch -y
# below .keys - generate SSH Keys for client and server as these will be used to execute ansible
ADD .keys/client/id_rsa /root/.ssh/id_rsa
ADD .keys/client/id_rsa.pub /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
COPY .keys/server/ /root/.ssh/
# allows localhost ssh connectivity
RUN cat /root/.ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub > /root/.ssh/known_hosts && cat /root/.ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub >> /root/.ssh/known_hosts && cat /root/.ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub >> /root/.ssh/known_hosts && mkdir -p /runner
# below assumes you have terraform binary locally and install it
ADD terraform /usr/local/bin
# add kubernetes and ibmcloud modules to ansible
RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin && ansible-galaxy collection install community.kubernetes && ansible-galaxy collection install ibmcloud.ibmcollection && yum install python3.x86_64 -y && pip3 install openshift

WORKDIR /runner
ENTRYPOINT [ "/usr/bin/ansible-playbook" ]
```

*Running in a container*

* Map the location of your playbook files and roles to the /runner directory
* Provide variables either as "extra vars" or in a file
* "apikey" must be included as one of the variables.

`docker run -it --rm -v <playbook directory>:/runner <image name> -i localhost -e "<variable name>=<value> <variable name>=<value> ..." <playbook name>`
