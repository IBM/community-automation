## Contributing to community-automation

## IMPORTANT

When developing automation that needs to be kept private, do so in a private repository that consumes the roles from this public community repository.  This can be done using collections or by referencing the roles in your own playbooks.  See readme for details.
 
To contribute code or documentation, create a fork, operate on your fork, and put in a [pull request](https://github.com/IBM/community-automation/pulls).

A good way to familiarize yourself with the codebase and contribution process is
to look for and tackle low-hanging fruit in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/IBM/community-automation/issues).

### Proposing new features

If you would like to implement a new feature, [raise an issue](https://github.com/IBM/community-automation/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=)  
before sending a pull request so the feature can be discussed. This is to avoid
you wasting your valuable time working on a feature that the project developers
are not interested in accepting into the code base.

### Fixing bugs

If you would like to fix a bug, [raise an issue](https://github.com/IBM/community-automation/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=) before sending a
pull request so it can be tracked.

### Merge approval

The project maintainers use LGTM (Looks Good To Me) in comments on the code
review to indicate acceptance. A change requires LGTMs from two of the
maintainers of each component affected.

For a list of the maintainers, see the [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) page.

## Communication
Please feel free to email the maintainers for question/comments/concerns.

## Coding style guidelines
**FIXME** Optional, but recommended: please share any specific style guidelines you might
have for your project.
